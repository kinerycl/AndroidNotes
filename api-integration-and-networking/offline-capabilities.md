# Offline Capabilities: Room Database and Data Synchronization

## Room Database
Room is an abstraction layer over SQLite that provides an easy way to persist data locally in Android apps. It allows for offline capabilities by caching data in a local database, which is useful when the device is not connected to the internet.

### Key Features:
- **Entity**: Represents a table in the database.
- **DAO (Data Access Object)**: Provides methods to access the database and interact with entities.
- **Database**: The main access point to the database, created using `Room.databaseBuilder()`.

### Example: Room Database Setup

```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "user")
data class User(
    @PrimaryKey val id: Int,
    val name: String,
    val email: String
)

@Dao
interface UserDao {
    @Insert
    suspend fun insert(user: User)

    @Query("SELECT * FROM user")
    suspend fun getAllUsers(): List<User>
}

@Database(entities = [User::class], version = 1)
abstract class AppDatabase : RoomDatabase() {
    abstract fun userDao(): UserDao
}

# Data Synchronization

To keep the app data up to date with the server, synchronization is necessary. You can fetch new data from the server when the app goes online and store it in the Room database.

## Common Strategies:
- **Background Sync**: Use WorkManager to perform background synchronization tasks when the device is connected to the internet.
- **Network-First Sync**: Check for a network connection and fetch data from the API. If offline, use cached data from the Room database.
- **Cache-First Sync**: Load data from the Room database first, and if necessary, update it with fresh data from the API.

## Example: Using WorkManager for Synchronization

```kotlin
class SyncWorker(appContext: Context, workerParams: WorkerParameters) : Worker(appContext, workerParams) {
    override fun doWork(): Result {
        // Check for network connectivity
        if (isNetworkAvailable()) {
            // Fetch data from the API
            syncDataFromApi()
        }
        return Result.success()
    }

    private fun isNetworkAvailable(): Boolean {
        // Implement network check logic
        return true
    }

    private fun syncDataFromApi() {
        // Fetch and save data to Room database
    }
}

// To schedule the worker
val syncRequest = OneTimeWorkRequestBuilder<SyncWorker>().build()
WorkManager.getInstance(context).enqueue(syncRequest)
```

## Benefits:
- **Offline Access**: Allows users to access app data even when thereâ€™s no internet connection.
- **Improved User Experience**: The app can still function when the network is unavailable.
- **Efficient Sync**: Syncing data in the background ensures that the user always has the latest information when they go online.

## Considerations:
- **Conflict Resolution**: You may need to handle conflicts between local and remote data (e.g., handling data updates while offline).
- **Data Storage Size**: Managing the size of the local database to avoid excessive storage use.

# Automated Testing: Unit, Integration, and UI Tests (Espresso, JUnit)

## Types of Tests:

### 1. **Unit Tests**  
Unit tests focus on testing individual units of code, such as functions or classes, to ensure they work as expected in isolation.  
- **Frameworks**: JUnit, Mockito, MockK.
- **Purpose**: Validate the logic of specific functions or methods.
- **Example**:
```kotlin
@Test
fun testAddition() {
    val result = 2 + 2
    assertEquals(4, result)
}
```
### Negatives of Using Mockito:

- **Testing Implementation Over Outcome**: Mockito tests how the code is written rather than testing the actual outcome of the code. This can lead to issues where changes in code implementation break tests, even if the functionality is still correct.
  
- **Fragility**: Tests written with Mockito can become fragile because they tightly couple the tests to the internal implementation details. This means that if the code changes, tests might break even though the changes don’t affect the functionality.

- **Longer Build Times**: Setting up and running Mockito-based tests can take a longer time, especially for complex mocks and large codebases. The increased time spent on building and running tests can slow down the development process.

- **Overuse of Mocks**: Overusing mocks in tests can lead to tests that don’t represent real-world scenarios and can make the tests harder to maintain, understand, and refactor.

- **Difficulty with Complex Interactions**: Mockito can struggle with mocking complex interactions or handling scenarios involving multiple dependencies and states, leading to tests that are hard to set up and debug.

## 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests focus on testing the interaction between multiple units or modules in the app to ensure they work together correctly.

- **Frameworks**: JUnit, Espresso, Retrofit (for network integration).
- **Purpose**: Ensure components like the database, network, and ViewModels interact properly.
- **Example**:
```kotlin
@Test
fun testNetworkAndDatabaseIntegration() {
    // Simulate fetching data from API
    val response = myApiService.fetchData()
    
    // Assert that the data is not null
    assertNotNull(response)
    
    // Save the response data to the database
    myDatabase.save(response)
    
    // Fetch the saved data from the database
    val savedData = myDatabase.getData()
    
    // Assert that the data saved in the database is correct
    assertEquals(response, savedData)
}
```

### 3. UI Tests (Espresso)

UI tests ensure that the user interface behaves correctly and that user interactions, like button clicks, lead to the expected outcomes.

- **Frameworks**: Espresso, UI Automator.
- **Purpose**: Test user interface behavior, button clicks, navigation, etc.
- **Example**: 

```kotlin
@Test
fun testButtonClick() {
    // Launch the activity
    onView(withId(R.id.my_button)).perform(click())
    
    // Check if a TextView is displayed after button click
    onView(withId(R.id.my_text_view)).check(matches(withText("Hello World")))
}
```

## Tools & Libraries
- **JUnit**: A testing framework for unit and integration tests. It provides annotations like `@Test`, `@Before`, `@After` for organizing tests.
- **Espresso**: A framework for writing UI tests in Android. It simplifies interaction with UI elements, making it easy to perform and verify actions on the UI.
- **Robolectric**: A testing framework for running Android tests on the JVM, allowing faster execution without requiring an emulator.
- **Shot / KotlinSnapshot**: Libraries for snapshot testing to ensure UI consistency across changes.

### Benefits:
- **Reliability**: Automated tests help ensure that code changes do not break functionality.
- **Regression Testing**: Quickly check that previous functionality is still working as expected after updates.
- **Faster Feedback**: Automating tests speeds up the development process by catching errors early.

### Considerations:
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure sufficient coverage for various parts of the application.
- **Flaky Tests**: Be mindful of flaky tests, especially in UI testing, which can lead to false positives/negatives.

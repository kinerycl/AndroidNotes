## Test-Driven Development (TDD) 🧪

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process where tests are written before the code itself. This approach ensures that the code is thoroughly tested and meets the required behavior before it's implemented.

### Steps in TDD:
1. **Red** 🟥: Write a failing test for a new feature or functionality.
2. **Green** 🟩: Write just enough code to pass the test.
3. **Refactor** 🔄: Refactor the code to improve it without changing its behavior, ensuring the test still passes.

### Benefits of TDD:
- **Early Bug Detection** 🐛: Since tests are written before the code, bugs are detected early in the development cycle.
- **Clear Requirements** 📋: Writing tests first clarifies what the code is supposed to do, helping developers understand the requirements.
- **Code Quality** 🧑‍💻: Encourages writing clean, modular code, as tests ensure functionality is covered.
- **Confidence in Refactoring** 🔧: With a solid test suite, developers can confidently refactor code, knowing that the tests will catch any regressions.

### Challenges:
- **Initial Learning Curve** 📚: Developers new to TDD may struggle with writing tests before the code.
- **Slower Initial Development** ⏱️: Writing tests before the code can slow down the initial development process.
- **Test Maintenance** 🧹: As code evolves, tests need to be maintained and kept in sync with the changes.

### Common Tools for TDD:
- **JUnit** 🧪: A framework for unit testing in Java, widely used for TDD in Android development.
- **MockK / Mockito** 🧩: Libraries for mocking dependencies in tests.
- **Espresso** 📱: Framework for writing UI tests in Android.
- **Robolectric** 🚀: Used for running Android tests on the JVM, useful for unit testing without an emulator.

### When to Use TDD:
- **Critical Functionality** ⚙️: When building mission-critical features or functionality where reliability is key.
- **Long-term Projects** 📆: In projects that are expected to evolve over time and require long-term maintainability.
- **When Refactoring** 🔄: If you're refactoring legacy code, TDD can help ensure that no functionality is lost during changes.
